While Nigeria borders the Atlantic Ocean, our country is more richly shaped by the vast network of rivers, tributaries, wetlands, and inland waterways that flow through our landscapes—from the mighty River Niger and River Benue to the countless creeks and streams that support life, livelihoods, and local ecosystems.

Yet, these lifelines are under threat.
From open drainage disposal and indiscriminate waste dumping to industrial effluents discharged into rivers, our waterways are bearing the brunt of human negligence. It's alarming how something as basic as discouraging open drainage dumping still remains a huge hurdle in many communities.

Even more concerning is the toxic runoff from oil spills and agricultural pesticides, which not only harms aquatic organisms but also pollutes groundwater systems, disrupting ecosystems and endangering public health.

In Nigeria, seasonal flooding in flood-prone areas continues to wreak havoc—yet we ignore the small habits that escalate these impacts: clogged water channels, poor waste management, and lack of awareness.

Awareness is the first step. Action is the next.

On this International Day of Action for Rivers, let’s do more than just talk—
- Educate your community.
- Advocate for sustainable water policies.
- Support local river protection initiatives.
- Adopt cleaner, more responsible waste practices.

Because healthy rivers mean a balanced ecosystem, safer communities, and a sustainable future.
Let’s protect what protects us.
