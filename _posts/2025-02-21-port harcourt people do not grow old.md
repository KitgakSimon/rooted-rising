I am a **Port Harcourt girl**, not an introvert, not a hustler who came here for work, but a true local who grew up in this vibrant city, knowing its every corner.

## The Sounds and Sights of Port Harcourt

I'm used to hearing commercial bus conductors shout **"Aba, Main Park Aba!"** loud and clear. (Education, Ola, Air Force, Mile One...) Our taxis and buses are mostly painted **blue and white**.

🚖 _Did you know?_ The cabs from **Eminiki to Waterline** are the oldest and most dilapidated in the city.  
🏗 **Eleme Junction** and the **Obiri-Ikwere Flyover** are two of the largest landmarks.

- **Alakahia** is not **Elekahia**
- **Mbguogba** is not **Rumuogba**
- **Rumuomasi** is not **Rumu-Osi**
