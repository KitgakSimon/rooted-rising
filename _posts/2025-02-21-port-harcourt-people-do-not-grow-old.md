I am a Port Harcourt girl, yes, not the introvert, not the one who came to Port Harcourt to hustle, but the local kid who grew up here and has an intimate familiarity with its nooks and crannies.

I am used to hearing commercial bus conductors shout "Aba, Main Park Aba" loud and clear. (Education, Ola, Air Force, Mile One...) Her taxis, as well as the buses, are mostly painted blue and white.
It should be noted that the cabs driving from Eminiki to Waterline are the oldest and most dilapidated in this city.
Eleme Junction and the Obiri-Ikwere flyovers are the two largest.

Please bear with me while I explain how this city's names might be misleading, particularly the "Rumu" syndrome.
Be aware that Ozuoba is not the same as Azuabie, and Alakaiah is not the same as Elekahia. Mbguogba is not Rumuogba, and Rumuomasi is not Rumu-Osi.

Don't get it twisted; Mile Three Market and Mile One Market are completely distinct; nonetheless, the former focuses mostly on food goods, while the latter focuses primarily on apparel. The greatest of them all is Creek Road Market. Every Wednesday is oil mill market day, but the Choba market is the most perplexing.

Just be aware that your coat should be trimmed to fit your size and strength if you wish to rent or purchase a home in this city. Diobu, Iwofe, Borokiri, Rumukwurushi, and Slaughter are not places where the weak should live. For big boys, there are places like Woji, GRA, and Odili Road. Other places for bigger boys are Naf Harmony, Olive Crest, Cocain, and RIVTAF Golf Estates among others.

Real estate sold all the properties along Stadium Road to hotels and event centers, while it sold the properties along GRA to nightclubs and luxurious restaurants.

For the wealthy, Furniture House in Trans-Amadi is the place to go if you want to purchase furniture, but for the rest of us, it's only a short trek to OCC Park on Ikwerre Road. If you want to buy lighting and electricals, go to Okija, Emenike. You may do all of your graphic design work in Diobu. Hausa people dey ground with beans and rice at Gambia. Of course, Ilabuchi is the greatest spot to purchase church instruments and used household appliances, while Ikokwu is the best place to get spare parts.

Office equipment buku for D-line and direct Belgium shoes plenty for D-line off Garrison.
Speaking of Garrison, when you get to the phone village, do not look back!!!
They can repair your phone and sell it to someone else in your presence of your front, hahaha.

Elekahia is where bole and fish originated, and now there is an annual celebration called the "Bole Festival" that takes place in the month of August.
Additionally, the Fruit Garden sells fruits and other ingredients that you may use to create fried rice and coleslaw.
If you want to change currencies, take a bolt to Presidential or Rumuola, but if you want to see where real estate dashed to Banks, then you should go to Olu Obasanjo Road.

If you are not traveling, do not pass Waterlines, I repeat, do not pass Waterlines. Similarly, if you do not want to style your hair or fix your lashes, do not approach Choba Junction or Ust Back Gate.

Girls, come closer, Orazi girls are ballers, no be for ‘’two hundred and fifty’’ k, if you don’t have money, avoid all the boutiques at Orazi and Rumuola. Avoid the salons at Orazi, avoid the make-up shops, in fact, avoid Orazi.

The most well-liked girls' schools in this city are Holy Rosary, Orominike Girls, and Rumueme Girls, while the best-liked boys' schools are Stella Maris and CSS Borokiri. The most contentious university is Ignatius Ajuru; despite claims that UST has few female students, Uniport is still regarded as the big boy.
Big men children dey attend schools like Charles Dale Memorial International School, Norwegian International School, and Bloombreed High School, among others.

The largest church in this city is Salvation Ministries, House on the Rock is the poshest, Carpenters, Kings Assembly, and Coza as well while OPM is popular for the prophetic.

The major media outlets are RSTV, WAZOBIA, and Radio Rivers, but you shouldn't ever underestimate the influence of portharcourtspecials.

I think Genesis Dulux, Pleasure Park, Boom Town, Asia Town, and Wood House are the most popular hangouts, while Port Harcourt Mall (Spar), Market Square, Every Day, and Livinchun are the most popular shops. let's add Hyper-City to the List.

Welcome to Port Harcourt where you should never allow the boys at Rumuokoro put pins on your new shoes, if not you will end up paying them for their service more money than you bought the shoes.

Let me mention some of the well-known local artists, like: Sabinus, Burnaboy, Omalay, Tonto Dikeh, Monalisa Chinda, Dukan Mighty, #funkyfour and Abgani Derego among others. Honourable Inhunwo Victor is the Mayo of Port Harcourt, Gloria Tuaka Borlo is one of Port Harcourt finest makeup plug, Israel Filmzblog the best wedding photographer, Chukwuemeka Stephanie is Miss Port Harcourt city Shelly's Makeover uniport funnest make up plug, I will give Portharcourt Specials Community a thumbs up for constantly informing this city and bringing it to the fore...

I am familiar with Port Harcourt; I know when to rush down the street and when to turn around, as well as the best routes to go during rush hour. Given the likelihood of flooding and the presence of black powder in the raindrops, I am aware that rain is not one of life's pleasant events here. I know that the sooty air caused by the constant gas flares and the bothersome oil spills has turned our dwellings black. Respiratory conditions like asthma and emphysema are a threat to everyone. pneumonia, cancer, nosebleeds, and skin irritation.

Although I'm aware that our city has a 41year life expectancy, I am also aware that bole speaks louder than words and that our asoebi is blue and white.
