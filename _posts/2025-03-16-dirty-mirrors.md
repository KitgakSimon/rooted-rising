You
look at me from the lenses of judgment,

A patriarchal, cynical view of what 

You think of me…

Your thoughts are daunted, for the moment

Clean your mirrors.

 

You see the dust first, before you see me.

Chattered glasses and your biases.

My weaknesses not my strength.

Supposed status, stratification, ideology

Clean your mirrors,

 

You look at me as the second sex,

Pieces of broken females_

femicide, depression, confusion, illusion

You look at me as just a caregiver, 

pains taker, weaker vessel…  

Take a wipes bro

Clean your mirrors.

 

You look at me with horrible laws

Shaved my hair for the passing of my partner

Took my crown, 

And made me an outsider, took away my father’s name and gave me no place in the
final cheque. 

 

Everyday,

I negotiate for my identity

In- Religion

hotel buildings

public spaces

Entertainment

Global market

even in family…

And I was the image in your dirty mirrors.

 

Dear Society

Not anymore!

 

I am, an awoke woman!!!

Not the one that nursed your patriarchal liturgies

Nor the one that sustained the pattern of grievances.

I am not the woman you disinherited in her father’s house

And made her a property in her husband’s house.

I am not that image you created!!!

 

I am not voiceless. 

You silenced me only for a while

My echo is an avalanche.

You raised me to shrink myself,

cater to your fragile ego,

And now I am your alter-ego

 

I am not the reason 

You don’t have detergents 

to clean up your mess

but I also know you have no intentions

to unsee what you see

from your Dirty mirrors,

 

And whether you clean the mirrors or not,

I pay you no mind!
