The past decade has been the warmest on record, and projections indicate that the next ten years will be even hotter, according to a report by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). 

Africa, bearing the brunt of climate change’s devastating impacts, can no longer afford temporary, surface-level solutions. It is imperative to shift toward nature-based solutions that align with the continent’s unique realities. 

Unfortunately, our policies remain heavily centered on carbon markets and offsets, failing to advance genuine alternatives that prioritize resilience and sustainability. 

We must critically evaluate and move beyond imported theories that do not reflect our lived experiences—many of which exacerbate existing vulnerabilities rather than solving them. 

True climate action for Africa must be rooted in locally driven, long-term strategies that restore ecosystems, empower communities, and ensure environmental justice.
