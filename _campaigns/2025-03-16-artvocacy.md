On October 17, 2024, Rooted Rising brought environmental education to life at State Primary School, Churchill 1 & 3, through an engaging and creative initiative. The goal? To equip young minds with the power of art as a tool for climate advocacy.

Students were introduced to the concept of using drawings and paintings to express environmental concerns, from deforestation to pollution and climate change. After an insightful session, they put their creativity to work in a competitive art exhibition, turning their ideas into powerful visual messages for change.

The event wasn't just about learningâ€”it was about impact. The best artworks were recognized with cash prizes and certificates, reinforcing the idea that creativity has value and can be a force for advocacy.

Rooted Rising believes that every child has a voice, and through art, they can inspire change.

 By instilling environmental consciousness at an early age, we are shaping future advocates who will stand for the planet.
