**Deals behind the Drills**

As oil giants like Shell quietly sell off their Nigerian assets, they’re trying to walk away from decades of devastation without cleaning up the mess. From Ogale to countless oil-impacted communities, the wounds of pollution, broken livelihoods, and abandoned promises remain wide open.

Rooted Rising’s *Deals behind the Drills* campaign will educate, activist, academia, communities and the general public on the divestment moves between companies divesting and companies investing. Rooted Rising is also inspiring everyone to make bold demands for accountability, and a just, transparent transition.

Divestment must not mean abandonment. It must mean restoration, justice, and real healing for our land and people.

Join us. Raise your voice. Demand justice.
