Our "Waste to Wealth" event at Government Comprehensive Secondary School (GCSS) Borokiri was a massive hit!

Today, we didn't just talk about plastic pollution - we took action!

The students amazed us with their creativity and energy as they turned discarded plastic waste into beautiful prototypes of useful items.

We saw firsthand how young minds can reshape our world, one small step at a time.

The future looks brighter with this next generation of eco-warriors ready to lead the charge for a cleaner, greener planet!

We are incredibly

optimistic about the impact these young change makers will have on their communities, using creativity and innovation to fight plastic and other waste pollution.

A big thank you to the amazing staff and students of GCSS, and to everyone who made this event a success! L Let's keep the momentum going as we continue to inspire action and advocate for a sustainableÂ future.
