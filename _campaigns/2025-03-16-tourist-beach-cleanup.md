On Saturday, October 12, 2024, the shores of Port Harcourt Tourist Beach witnessed an inspiring display of environmental stewardship as Plogging Nigeria hosted a vibrant cleanup campaign. Volunteers, environmental enthusiasts, and community members came together, armed with gloves and trash bags, to tackle plastic pollution and restore the beauty of the coastline.

The Rooted Rising Initiative was on the ground, not just to lend a helping hand but to amplify the voices of those taking action. Our team engaged in meaningful conversations with participants, capturing their motivations, reflections, and hopes for a cleaner future. From first-time volunteers to seasoned environmental advocates, each participant had a unique story to share—stories of responsibility, resilience, and the urgent need for collective action against pollution.

One participant emphasized, *“Seeing the amount of plastic waste here today is shocking. It reminds us that our daily choices matter, and we need to be more mindful of how we dispose of waste.”* Another shared, *“It feels amazing to be part of something bigger, to know that our little efforts today contribute to a healthier environment.”*

The event was more than just a cleanup—it was a call to action. As plastic waste continues to threaten marine ecosystems and human health, initiatives like this play a crucial role in raising awareness and fostering a culture of environmental responsibility.

Rooted Rising Initiative remains committed to storytelling as a powerful tool for advocacy. Through interviews, content creation, and engagement, we will continue to highlight the efforts of individuals and organizations working towards a sustainable future.
