On October 10th, 2025, the Rooted Rising Initiative joined others in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, to honor the memory of Ken Saro-Wiwa at his 30th Memorial Lecture.

Standing in the city where his voice once thundered for justice reminded us why we do what we do, to keep telling the stories he fought for, to protect the land he loved, and to ensure that his courage never fades into silence, for silence would be treason!

Kenâ€™s legacy lives on in every act of resistance, in every story told, and in every community rising for environmental justice.
