The **Rooted Rising Initiative** stood in solidarity with the global movement against gender-based violence (GBV) during the **16 Days of Activism** campaign, using the power of mimes, graphics, short videos, and articles to demand justice, educate the girl child, and expose the rising cases of femicide.

In a world where violence against women and girls remains rampant, we believe that storytelling—through visual, performance, and digital media—can ignite change. Our mimes spoke the silent yet painful realities of survivors, our graphics and videos amplified the urgent call for action, and our articles shed light on the systemic issues that fuel GBV.

This campaign was more than just a moment; it was a movement. We called for policies that protect women, accountability for perpetrators, and a cultural shift that empowers girls to speak up and claim their rights. Every voice raised, every story shared, and every image created brought us one step closer to a just world.

The fight for gender justice doesn’t end after 16 days.

 At Rooted Rising, we remain committed to using art, advocacy, and education to drive lasting impact. 

**Justice. Equality. Change.** The time is now.
