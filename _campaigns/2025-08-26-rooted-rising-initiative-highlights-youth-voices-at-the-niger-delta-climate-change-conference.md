Rooted Rising Initiative Highlighted Youth voices at the Niger Delta Climate Change Conference hosted by the LEKEH Development Foundation, we had the chance to interview young people and really listen. 

They spoke honestly about what climate justice means to them, and how climate finance often feels distant from the realities of life in the Niger Delta. Their words carried both frustration and hope — a reminder that the future of this region can’t be decided without the voices of those who will inherit it.

At Rooted Rising, we believe these youth voices are not just part of the conversation, they are the *heart of it*. Their courage to speak up in a space often dominated by older and more powerful voices shows us what real leadership looks like.
