Rooted Rising trained students from the University of Port Harcourt and young advocates from various youth organizations on Emerging Technology and the Climate Narrative — exploring how digital tools, AI, and data are shaping climate communication, activism, and even misinformation.

We explored how AI, data, and digital platforms are influencing what people believe about the climate crisis — from real awareness campaigns to dangerous funded propaganda and disinformation.

It was eye-opening to see how technology can both spread truth and twist it, how greenwashing hides behind fancy tech terms, and frameworks and how digital tools can also help us fact-check, tell better stories, and demand accountability.

The big question we left with was simple:
If there is an information warfare, how do we own the battlefield?

We would love to hear your thoughts.
