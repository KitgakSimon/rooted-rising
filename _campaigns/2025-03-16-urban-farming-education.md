On October 16, 2024, in celebration of World Food Day, Rooted Rising Initiative partnered with **AKOJOBEN Limited** to introduce students at State Primary School, Churchill 1 & 3 to "urban farming," equipping them with practical knowledge on sustainable food production. The event emphasized the importance of local food systems and how young people can actively participate in growing food using limited space.
