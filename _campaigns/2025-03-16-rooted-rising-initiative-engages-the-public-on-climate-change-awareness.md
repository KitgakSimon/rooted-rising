In July 2024, the Rooted Rising Initiative took to the streets of Port Harcourt to gauge public knowledge about climate change through a public interview session. This initiative was designed to assess how well people understand climate issues, their impact, and the role of communities in fostering climate resilience.

The street interviews revealed a mix of insights—while some respondents demonstrated awareness of climate change, others struggled to connect it to their daily experiences. Many participants cited flooding, extreme heat, and unpredictable rainfall as challenges they face but were unaware of the deeper links to global climate shifts and human activities like deforestation and fossil fuel dependence.

Through this engagement, Rooted Rising not only gathered crucial data on public perception but also used the opportunity to educate and inspire action.

This public interview marked another step in Rooted Rising’s mission to use storytelling, advocacy, and creative engagement to drive climate action in Nigeria. Moving forward, the initiative plans to expand such awareness campaigns and explore ways to bridge the knowledge gap between climate science and everyday realities.
